1. create Custom Type Menu
    - single type
    - in static zone
            - Add a new Field on top left ( as Group) name it => Menu Items
            - Add Field inside Menu Items => Label( as Key Text) and Link (as Link)
            (if type Link we should add absolute path, or work around it instead of Link we can add Key Text)
